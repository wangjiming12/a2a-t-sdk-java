## Project Overview

`a2a-t-sdk-java` is a Java SDK targeting telecom scenarios, used to generate task prompts and handle task negotiation flows.

This SDK is primarily aimed at two types of users:

- Client: Generates task prompts based on user input, and initiates, receives, and advances negotiation flows.
- Server: Validates `processed task prompts` that conform to the SDK format, and initiates, receives, and advances negotiation flows.

## Core Capabilities

- Task prompt generation pipeline: Covers input normalization, scenario recognition, slot extraction, and task prompt rendering.
- Client API: Provides a task prompt generation result stream, along with negotiation entry points such as `start_negotiation`, `receive_negotiation`, and `continue_negotiation`.
- Server validation API: Targets `processed task prompts` that conform to the SDK format, performing metadata parsing, slot extraction.
- Negotiation types: Includes four built-in negotiation types: `information`, `clarification`, `feasibility`, and `fulfillment`.
- Resource organization: Built-in prompt resources are located in `a2a-t-resources/src/main/resources/prompt_resources`, containing `prompts`, `scenarios`, `slots`, and `templates`.
- Built-in example scenario: Currently, the package provides scenarios such as`subscribe_incident`.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as a Maven multi-module reactor, with core code under each module's `src/main/java`. The main modules are:

- `a2a-t-bom`: Bill of materials (BOM) that aligns library module versions.
- `a2a-t-core`: Shared `.env`-driven configuration loading, value types, JSON parsing abstractions, and the exception processing.
- `a2a-t-resources`: Packaging and classpath loading of built-in prompt resources.
- `a2a-t-llm`: LLM adapter layer, unified externally as an OpenAI-compatible client.
- `a2a-t-prompt`: Prompt resource model and loading, scenario recognition, slot extraction, and template rendering.
- `a2a-t-negotiation`: Negotiation types, runtime state machine, and state storage.
- `a2a-t-client`: Client facade providing task prompt generation and negotiation entry points.
- `a2a-t-server`: Server facade providing `processed task prompt` validation and negotiation entry points.
- `a2a-t-sample`: Runnable client/server sample.

## Installation and Environment Requirements

- Java requirement: `>=17`
- Build tool: Maven (no wrapper is bundled; install it locally)
- Group ID: `net.openan.a2a-t.sdk`
- License: `Apache-2.0`
- It is recommended to import `a2a-t-bom` to align module versions:

Before starting, edit `client.env` / `server.env` at the repo root (or refer to `env.example`) and fill in a valid `A2AT_LLM_API_KEY` and other settings.

## Development and Testing

The project uses a Maven multi-module reactor build, with code formatting unified by `spotless-maven-plugin` (Palantir Java Format) and tests based on JUnit 5 (Jupiter).

Each module's `src/test/java` mirrors the main package structure, covering the negotiation state machine, the four negotiation type handlers, classpath and local-file loaders, prompt rendering, and client/server orchestration. For a runnable end-to-end sample, see `a2a-t-sample` and [a2a-t-sample/README.zh-CN.md](a2a-t-sample/README.zh-CN.md).

## Current Scope of Support

Before use, it is recommended to confirm the following limitations:

- The built-in LLM invocation chain is unified externally as an OpenAI-compatible adaptation layer.
- Prompt resources currently only support local files.
- Negotiation state storage currently only provides an in-memory implementation and does not guarantee persistence.
- The bundled resources and language coverage are limited, and do not include remote resource loading capabilities such as `registry`.
- This document primarily introduces the SDK itself, and does not cover the CLI, hosted services, deployment processes, or ready-to-use application solutions.
